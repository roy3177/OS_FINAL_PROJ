    Breadth-First Search (BFS) to find an augmenting path using a lambda function:

    *auto lets the compiler deduce the type.
    *[&] means the lambda captures all local variables by reference (so it can use and modify them).
    *(int s, int t) are the parameters: s is the source node, t is the sink node.
    *-> bool means the lambda returns a boolean value.

    What does the lambda do?

    *It performs a Breadth-First Search (BFS) from node s to node t in the residual graph.
    *It tries to find an augmenting path (a path with available capacity).
    *If it finds such a path, it returns true; otherwise, it returns false.
    *It also fills the parent vector so it's possible to reconstruct the path later.
